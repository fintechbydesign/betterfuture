        Welcome to deedit
        The deedit project is a digital social experiment to prove that the smallest action can make a positive difference to Edinburgh.   We want to see whether people are willing to do a small good deed to help a local cause, like homelessness.
        How it works
        Simply choose which cause you are interested in helping and pick a good deed to complete.  Then upload a photo or video to the webapp at deedit.org to tell us that your deed is complete.   In return, you will be awarded a digital badge, which you can view on your deedit profile page.  All the deeds will be counted and we will track progress against the big targets or "Mega Deeds", like Reducing Homelessness in Edinburgh or Making Edinburgh Green.
        Who we are
        The Deedit project is organised and run by Tesco Bank and is a part of a showcase of prototypes and interactive installations by Edinburgh University.  The deedit project will run between 2 – 25 August as part of an exhibition called "Data Pipe Dreams: Glimpses of a Near Future".  To find out more, go to: www.designinformatics.org/event/data-pipe-dreams.
        As part of the Edinburgh festival, deedit is partnering with Social Bite, a local charity which aims to eradicate homelessness in Edinburgh.
        These Terms of Use, together with the deedit privacy policy, govern your participation in the deedit project and use of deedit webapp. When you provide information through your participation in the deedit project, you agree to these terms.   If you do not agree to these terms, including the privacy policy, please do not upload anything to deedit.  These Terms of Use constitute an agreement between you and Tesco Bank Personal Finance plc, trading as "deedit".
        How we use your data
        Data collected during the project
        During the project, deedit will collect the following information if you choose to provide it:
        -	Your nickname – the name you choose to call yourself to participate in deedit
        -	Age range
        -	Country you are from, and if Scotland which city you are from
        -	Location data from your device (if you agree to it through the pop up on the website)
        -	Photos of deeds completed
        -	any further information that you give to us when you contact us.
        When you go to deedit.org we assign a random ID to your device.  This is not a device ID and it does not track you or your location.  It is used so that if you decide to complete more than one deed we remember to show you your profile and your next deed can be added to your profile.   This is the only personalised service on deedit.
        We do not capture any other information like device operating systems, IP addresses, signals, data etc.
        For more details as to how deedit will use and store your data, please see our privacy policy here [insert hyperlink].
        What happens to the data collected during the  project
        The findings from the project will be used to write a research paper about what happened during the project.   The research paper will not contain any personal information.  The data on which the research paper will be based,  will then be deleted after 1 month.
        What happens to the photos posted on deedit during the project
        You are given a choice whether to post a photo or agree to a pledge to confirm your deed has been completed.  It is not mandatory to post a photo.  Photos which are posted will be screened for appropriateness and suitable content.  Photos will be visible publicly in the Design Informatics Pavilion on a tv screen as part of the project, and will be visible on the webapp.  After the project the photos will be shared with Social Bite, who can use them on verified Social Bite social media channels (such as its Facebook, Instagram and Twitter pages)  to help promote their vision to eradicate homelessness in Scotland.
        On 30 September 2018 all data and photos collected during the Edinburgh festival will be deleted.
        Your Commitments
        We want the deedit project to be as open and inclusive as possible, but we also want it to be safe, secure and in accordance with the law. Anyone can participate, but if you are under 13 years old, you will need the permission of your parent/guardian before participating.
